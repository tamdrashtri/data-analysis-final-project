## Final Project: 

Predicting Churn using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, .

Logistic Regression: trying to fit the certain curve to the data

## Main question: 

What predictive (make sure every model is predictive) models (machine learning algorithm) perform best to predict the churn rate in the telecom industry? 

--> to infer the future from the past - then 

relationship between the two - infer the relationships to make predictions - 
a lot of them create black box - don't know how to know - link them back to the data - i don't 
does this aspect helps explain the variance in the data - role of variables - what affects churn?
they predict the future churn. 



## Hypothesis: 

Complex machine learning models have more predictive powers compared to simple algorithms.

think why more complex models are
- it's a very complex powers but no predictive power. 

- how do different methods compared 
- how good is logistic regression
- they are all used, long time to run 
- how much better it is in predicting. 
- chop it in two - test given this data and predict the churn. 


## What is the final product?

I will use a Shiny dashboard to present my findings.
