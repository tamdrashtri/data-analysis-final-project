## Final Project: 

Predicting Churn using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, .

## Main question: 

What machine learning algorithm perform best to predict the churn rate in the telecom industry? 

## Hypothesis: 

Complex machine learning models have more predictive powers compared to simple algorithms.

## What is the final product?

I will use a Shiny dashboard to present my findings.
