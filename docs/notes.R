# - different methods but the same question
# - could train as black box - to see how well they do
# - do equally well, we expect the same result that comes out
# - if one of them - unlikely that they gave the same wrong answers
# - check how good they do - dive in one model to see how they perform
# - how do all three different methods perform - tell me the same thing - sort of give the right answer - i don't know the right answer is.
# - how well this model is able to analyze the data - using the model performance metric.
